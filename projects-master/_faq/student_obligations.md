question: "What are my obligations as a student during the GSoC?"
---
We expect you to:

* Be active on [gitter](https://coala.io/chat).
* Blog at least once per week (this will be aggregated on
[blog.coala.io](https://blog.coala.io)).
* Participate in weekly meetings with your mentor.
* Review PRs of other students and contributors. This is a big part of open
source work and we'll make sure to help you get started.
* All code you want to merge has to have full test coverage and documentation.
* If anything, for whatever reason, looks
to be problematic, talk to your mentor or an admin!

And Again:
__Get in contact with your mentors or the admins if any even remotely
potential problems arise!__
