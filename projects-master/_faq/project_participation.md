question: "Do all listed projects will be part of GSoC (or any other initiative)?"

No.
We have way too many projects and you are even invited to add your own ideas.
This means that the listed projects are just ideas for you.

But as long as we have good applications and spots, projects will happen.
Where there are good students, good projects will happen ;)
