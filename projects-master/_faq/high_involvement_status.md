question: "What is the meaning of High Involvement status of any project?"
---

It simply means that the project already has more than one proposal and if you
want to submit the proposal for the project, you should make sure that your
proposal should have some extra elements with a clear concept.
Since we can't accept two proposals for the same project, the best solution will be
that you should choose any other project to write a proposal.

In simple language your proposal should be freaking awesome.
