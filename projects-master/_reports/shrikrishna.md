### Newcomer Metrics and Gamification

This project is about automating the recognition of activities performed
by people who join the coala community, and encourage them to progress
towards obtaining the role of "Developer" in the community.

This project incorporated a gamification system which allows us to track
the progress of newcomers activities and assign some points to each of the
activities they do. The newcomers will get some score which will be the sum
of all the points they have earned by performing several activities. The score
they get will be a deciding factor for the current 'Level' of the newcomer and
the activities they perform will be a deciding factor for 'Badges' they have
earned.

coala always tries to be a welcoming organization for newcomers, giving them
clear pathways and as much direct assistance as possible. However, it is
already known that newcomers face many barriers while attempting to contribute
to open source for the first time, and additional barriers while attempting to
contribute to projects run by the coala organization. On the other hand,
gamification is widely used to engage and motivate people to accomplish tasks
and improve their performance.

Thus, the goal of this project is to use gamification to orient and motivate
newcomers to overcome onboarding barriers to contribute and engage with coala
and its community.

#### Work Done

##### Creating the APIs

To build the gamification app, there was a need of constant data supply of all
the activities newcomers do, i.e. Getting a pull request merge, Creating an
issue and sending messages to the gitter channels. The work to achieve the same
has been done in the [webservices](https://gitlab.com/coala/landing/) repo. And
the output of all the script can be viewed at
[webservices.coala.io](https://github.com/sks444/webservices.coala.io/commit/9d263725)
which is a workaround to get a fixed URL for all the APIs until there is the
integration of continuous deployment in the webservices.

##### Building the Gamification system

The second and the important part of my work, from
[importing](https://github.com/coala/community/commit/537602ec) the useful
newcomers data to building the
[gamification app](https://github.com/coala/community/commit/ef814f6e)
has been done in the [community](https://github.com/coala/community) repo. And
now we have a [leaderboard](http://coala-community.netlify.com/gamification/)
which shows the score, current level and the badges earned by all the active
newcomers at coala.

#### Challenges

The biggest challenge for me was to design the models of the gamification
system and choosing the correct path to implement the process. I almost did
the wrong implementation of the process twice but again because of well written
[cEP](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0020.md) and the guidance of
my mentor John I had a clear idea of what I have to achieve. So, I did some more
thinking and research on Django and get the basic work done. And once the
algorithms were in place everything went smoothly with the reviews of my
mentors.

#### Work to be done

1). Integration of continous deployment to the webservices.

2). Use real webservices APIs.

3). The leaderboard on community website is very basic. It could be prettified
    and improved.

4). Add support of Gitter messages analysis to the gamification app.
    [WIP](https://github.com/coala/community/pull/145).
