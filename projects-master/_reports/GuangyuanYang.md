bio: >
  I am a sophomore studying Mathematics and Computer Science at the University
  of Waterloo. I participated in GSoC 2018 and worked with
  [coala](https://coala.io) to improve linter dependency management, the goal
  of which in the duration of this year's GSoC is to have Go Linters installed
  automatically on bare-metal BSD systems, with a post-GSoC goal of supporting
  more platforms and more kinds of dependencies.

         [Merge Request] Demonstration of recursive installation

### Go Bears on BSD

#### Work Done

Support for FreeBSD and Go packages have been added to
[`dependency_management`](https://gitlab.com/coala/package_manager), the
working repo. The GitLab-based Continuous Integration (CI) config has been
enhanced. An official FreeBSD CI server is up, and all supported tests are now
also running on BSD.

`dependency_management` tool is now capable of recursively resolving
dependencies down to the system level, with some implementations still under
investigation/review. Based on this feature, I implemented a
[script](https://gist.github.com/yzgyyang/13ebb46a5c90ac624b5c6eb43deedc0d) to
demonstrate the ability of bootstrapping coala Go bears on a bare-metal FreeBSD
system
([Screen record for the demo](https://asciinema.org/a/0poVbHE7lqehV4islFo6cptjb)),
and it can be expanded to support multiple platforms.

Further design and implementation issues have been identified and logged.

Aside from the project, I got myself involved in the community by reporting and
solving issues across the coala and coala-bears repo and also in upstream
projects. I also did code review and helped other newcomers get onboard.

#### Challenges

Most tasks went smoothly. The FreeBSD CI part is challenging, since such
infrastructure doesn't exist before, and thus it takes a lot of time to do
experiments and testing to make things right.

The end goal of this project is open-ended while the timeframe is limited,
which I found to be the most challenging part of the project. Aside from the
actually coding part, I spent much time and energy exploring different package
management tools, and communicating with my mentors and maintainers of related
internal projects, in order to find the best design choices.

#### Work to be done

The FreeBSD CI could be improved by adding a new runner
[upstream](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/3358).

Support for more BSDs and more bears could be implemented, and more design
documents should be logged.

The concept of recursively installation on Unix-like platforms is proved, but
the actual inplementation of such feature requires more discussion about the
design in a longer timeframe. I plan to continue following up on this in the
future.

Resolving dependencies using Repology metadata is a nice addition to the
project. It was planned to be implemented in accordance with the
[Automation of Dependency Management using Repology](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=automation_of_dependency_management_using_repology&lang=en)
project, but this part seems to be stale at the moment.
