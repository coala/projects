bio: >
  I am a final year student (expected graduation date: May 2019) of Computer
  Science at The University of Hong Kong. I participated in GSoC and worked
  with [coala](http://coala.io) to implement a meta-review system, which
  collects and tracks GitHub reactions used by coala community to generate
  meaningful analysis. I also improved usability of
  [gh-board](http://github.com/coala/gh-board), a serverless kanban board,
  fixing some issues and extending it to track reviews & meta-reviews.

### Meta-review


#### Work Done

coala [community](https://github.com/coala/community) website now has a
meta-review [ranking list](http://coala-community.netlify.com/meta-review/).

coala gh-board [website](https://coala-gh-board.netlify.com/)
now has a column displaying review comments that need to be meta-reviewed.
I also fixed many issues around [gh-board](https://github.com/coala/gh-board)
repo. I sent some patches to upstream repos, including pull request
[philschatz/gh-board#147](https://github.com/philschatz/gh-board/pull/147), and
[ryanprior/gh-board#1](https://github.com/ryanprior/gh-board/pull/1). Those
enhancements are generic for any gh-board user, thus we have been hoping that
the upstream gh-board repos will become better maintained.

Apart from all above, I did some other contributions to the community,
including doing reviews, and fixing several issues around coala & coala-bears
repo.

#### Challenges

Most things went smoothly. The biggest challenge for me was that I did not
have serious frontend experience. Before I applied for this project, I had no
frontend development knowledge at all, while two thirds of my project was about
javascript and React. Luckily, org admin and all my mentors were very willing
to help and review my work. coala community always do extremely careful reviews
and expect high quality of code. It was hard work for me, but I did learn a lot
at the same time.

#### Work to be done

The ranking list on community website is very basic. It could be prettified and
improved. As it is a ranking list, filtering, sorting & searching options could
be added. The algorithm used in the meta-review ranking system is basic: it uses
naive iterative algorithm to calculate scores, which can be enhanced in the
future.

There are still some issues around with gh-board. A major improvement which can
be done is GitLab support - it currently only supports GitHub.
