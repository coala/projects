[GitMate.io](https://gitmate.io/) is an automation tool for developers and it lacks
[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) support.
Many open source projects and companies use Jira.

For more information about Jira and their REST API, you can look at 
[an existing Python implementation](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira#jira-python-library).

This project involves adding a Jira implementation to [IGitt](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/IGitt/)
as well as using that within [GitMate.io](https://gitmate.io/) (i.e. add webhooks and "signup with jira").

We look forward to hearing about your approach to making this happen. If you
want, you can define optional goals which could be little snippets of 
automation targeted to Jira users. 
(See also [our documentation about creating plugins](http://docs.gitmate.io/Developers/Writing_Plugin/).)

Please ask us for a Jira license to play around with at any time.
