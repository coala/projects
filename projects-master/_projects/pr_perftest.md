This project is based on the research work done in "Commit-based
performance testing". This is basically taking that research and
applying it to GitMate, creating a Codecov for performance
measurement.

With this integrated into GitMate, the project could receive direct and
immediate feedback on how a particular pull request affected their
performance. This would also use the previously researched algorithms
to identify the commits that lead to performance changes.
