[coala-quickstart](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart) is a tool that
helps users to quickly get started with coala. It generates a `.coafile`
(coala's configuration file) that is tailored to the project. Currently,
coala-quickstart automatically identifies relevant bears for the project
based on the languages used and has a clean and simple command-line interface
for taking user’s input when required.

However, there’s scope for improvement in the following areas:

- Utilizing information from common configuration files: Some projects have
  configuration files like `Gruntfile.js`, `Gulpfile.js`, `rakefile`,
  `package.json`, etc., which may contain useful data that's relevant to
  coala-quickstart. For example, if a project's Gulpfile.js specifies which
  files are to be linted with csslint, we could use this information to target
  CSSLintBear at exactly these files.
- Improving the interface:
	- Removing non user-friendly warnings.
	- Increasing automation.
	- Validate user input before writing to the generated coafile.
- Continuous Integration: Like other coala repositories, add Appveyor
  (Windows) and Travis (OSX) integartions.


#### Milestones

##### [PREPARATION/BONDING](https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC/GSoC-2017/milestones/6) 4th May - 29th May
* [X] Identified all the kinds of configuration files to be worked
  on in the project.
* [X] Figure out all the useful information that could be
  extracted from these files.
* [X] Get the cEP https://github.com/coala/cEPs/issues/80 merged.
