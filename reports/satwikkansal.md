bio: >
 I'm a final year Software Engineering undergrad from Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India. I was a Google Summer of Code student for coala over the summer of 2017 and primarily worked on the tool [coala-quickstart](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart). My project involved developing an information extraction & utilization framework for project files and improving the existing CLI of quickstart.

### Enhance coala-quickstart

#### Work Done

[coala](https://coala.io) is a modular and language-agnostic tool for performing static code analysis. [coala-quickstart](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart) is a tool designed to do all the boilerplate work for coala and help users to quickly get started with coala.

**Major tasks of the project:**

- Developing a framework for extracting Infromation of interest from different kinds of project files.
- Extracting useful information from the following files:
  - `Gruntfile.js`
  - `.editorconfig`
  - `package.json`
  - `Gemfile`

  More information about each of the files can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/coala/GSoC-2017/issues/21)
- Utilizing the information extracted from project files to
  - Suggest static code analysis routines to users
  - Automatically identify values required for settings in `.coafile` (coala's configuration file)
  - Detect inconsistencies among files
- Recommending and Filtering static code analysis routines to users based on:
  - [Capabilities](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Native_Bears.html#can-detect-and-can-fix) selected by the users.
  - A curated list of static code analysis routines.
  - Insights about static code analysis tools already used by the project.
- Improving the existing CLI by
  - Adding auto-complete feature for project files
  - Allowing flexibility in user input (Example: "yeah!!", "obviously", etc will be automatically mapped to `True` in boolean-type inputs)
  - Validating user inputs
- Adding Continuous Integration support for Windows.

Check out the lateset [release](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coala-quickstart/0.4.0) of coala-quickstart to see all of the above discussed features in action!

#### Challenges

Overall, it was a wonderful and satisfying experience.

* The first challenge for me was to come up with a feasible and promising project on my own. Initially, I was skeptical about the utility and the usefulness of my project. But in the end, everything turned out pretty good.
* I was also doing an internship, so the biggest challenge for me was to manage my time accordingly. There were some moments, when it felt like it's gonna be difficult to complete my tasks and deliver a useful solution, but the weekly meetings with [Adhityaa](https://github.com/adtac)(which lasted somewhere between 15 minutes to 2+ hrs) really helped me plan everything much ahead of time. Good planning and initial discussion made the code review and merge process much easier for my mentors.
* Development wise, the challanges were to design and document my approach in the cEPs (implementation was very smooth after that), and to make all the CIs work together at once :P (Thanks to [John](https://github.com/jayvdb) for helping me in some of the issues related to CI)

#### Work to be done

There's still a long way to go for coala-quickstart and the most important thing to watch out for is the [aspects](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md) project which will simplify the configurations for the users to a lot extent. So, once the aspects project is completely ready, the first step should be to integrate aspects into quickstart.

Apart from that, there's also scope to extract useful information from meta files like `Gulpfile.js`, `requirements.txt`, etc which were not covered in my project. Finally, some minor features and improvements are also discussed in these [issues](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/issues/created_by/satwikkansal).

#### Thanks giving!

Thanks a lot to all my fellow coalians for making my so far wonderful journey with coala. It's been around 9 months since I started contributing to coala and I've learned a lot till now. A very very special thanks to [Adhityaa](https://github.com/adtac) for helping me constantly throughout the summer despite of his own internship. He was quick in doing critical code reviews and absolutely a fun mentor to work with (not to mention the interesting conversations between [Adrian](https://github.com/Adrianzatreanu) and him during the initial weekly meetings).

I'll definitely keep on contributing to coala-quickstart and coala in general after my GSoC.
