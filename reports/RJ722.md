bio: >
 I'm a sophomore year student studying Electronics Engineering at Zakir Hussain
 College of Engineering and Technology, Aligarh Muslim University. For GSoC,
 I worked on [coala](https://coala.io), [vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture)
 and [VultureBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/bears/python/VultureBear.py).
 The main task of this project was to let VultureBear remove dead code automatically.

### Remove dead code with Vulture automatically

#### Work Done

**vulture**

<br>

1.) In addition to the first line of unused code, Vulture now reports the last 
line of unused code. The results can now also be sorted according to their size.

<br>

2.) Other than the conventional dead code (defined but not used), vulture 
now also finds unsatisfiable conditions in `if/while` statements. Also,
any code appearing after `return`, `break`, `continue` and `raise` statements 
is also reported as dead code.

<br>

3.) Confidence values are now reported with every result. Also, a 
`min_confidence` parameter can be passed to Vulture. It then only reports 
results for which `confidence` > `min_confidence`.

<br>

4.) The Vulture API has been extended and it now exhibits all characteristics 
of dead code, like `confidence`, `first_lineno`, `last_lineno`, `message`, etc. 
It provides user with much more flexibility for automating tests with Vulture.

<br>

5.) Improved whitelist handling process: Every import is now checked
against a corresponding whitelist file (both files must have the same
names), which makes it very easy to add support for new whitelists.

<br>

6.) Vulture is now distributed as a Python `wheel`.

<br>

7.) Allow Vulture to be executed as a package (`python -m vulture`).

<br>

8.) A lot of work was done upstream on Vulture. Afterwards, `VultureBear`
    was refactored to use the new Vulture API. This increased the efficiency
    of the Bear. It is now completely tested and documented in-place.
