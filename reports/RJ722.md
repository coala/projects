bio: >
 I'm a sophomore year student studying Electronics Engineering at Zakir Hussain
 College of Engineering and Technology, Aligarh Muslim University. For GSoC,
 I worked on [coala](https://coala.io) and [vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture)
 to build the vulture API which allows vulture to be used as a script, and which powers
 [VultureBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/bears/python/VultureBear.py).

### Auto-removal of dead code through vulture

#### Work Done

**vulture**

<br>

1.) vulture now alongside results also offers the source range of the object.
The results can now also be sorted according to their size. This make it
easier to integrate it with the `VultureBear`.

<br>

2.) Other than the conventional dead code (defined but not used), vulture can
now also scavenge upon unsatisfiable conditions in `if/while` statements. Also,
any code appearing after `return`, `break` statements is also reported as dead
code.

<br>

3.) confidence values are now reported with every result. Also, a
`min_confidence` parameter can be passed which only allows results for which
`confidence` > `min_confidence`.

<br>

4.) The new vulture API -- vulture's utility is now extended as an API which
transmits all characteristics of dead code, like `confidence`, `first_lineno`,
`last_lineno`, `message`, etc. It provides user with much more flexibility
with automating tests with vulture.

<br>

5.) **Improved whitelist handling process:** Every import is now checked
against a corresponding whitelist file(both the files must have the exact same
names), which makes it very easy to add support for new whitelists.

<br>

6.) vulture is now distributed as a python `wheel`.

<br>

7.) Allow vulture to be executed as a package (`python -m vulture`).

<br>

Much work had to be done upstream on `vulture`. The task at hand then was to
then just intgerate the new vulture API with VultureBear and to write test
cases. It increased the efficiency of the Bear manyfold.

<br>

NOTE: The yet newer version isn't merged so far. The ongoing progress can be
monitored here: [coala/coala-bears#2000](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/pull/2000)

#### Work to be done

Implement `get_report`: To provide even more finer grain control over the
results yielded by vulture, add `Item.get_report` method. This helps in
keeping the code more modular, as the formatting and reporting are both done
at different places and also provides an interface to filter out results based
on their messages.
