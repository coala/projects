bio: >
 I'm a final year student of Computer Science & Engineering at University School of Information,
 Communication & Technology, GGS IP University. I participated in GSoC and worked with [coala](https://coala.io) to facilitate users to use coala online and functionality for one click Git Repository linting. I also worked on a bot to generate coafile, worked on improving UI of coala-html and configurability of coala-projects. I also worked on adding Notification and Thread support in the IGitt library.

### Improve coala Website and Supporting Tools


#### Work Done

The coala Online module now has support for all the bears, bears with optional as well as non optional settings, everything can be configured. Users can perform code analysis online with any given bear. The project enhanced coala-html by introducing results and bear search and filtering on basis of parameters. A coafile_bot is created which can be used to generate coala configuration file for any given GitHub repository. One click git repository linting is possible online. A CSS framework was built upon MaterializeCSS for coala web projects [coalaCSS](https://github.com/coala/coalaCSS) and its being used via CDN at webservices.coala.io, projects.coala.io, coala.io, school.coala.io and other coala web projects.

<br>

coala-quickstart has got a new running mode, allow-incomplete-sections which helps users to create a coafile without omitting bears with non optional settings. 

<br>

IGitt now supports Notifications and Threads for GitHub and partially for GitLab (Notifications API is not available on GitLab as of now).

<br>

projects.coala.io is now Jekyll based and configurable via a YAML file. It also has a more conflict free approach while simultaneously adding projects.

<br>

coala Online module is live and running [here](https://coala.io/#/coalaonline).

<br>
coala-html is more powerful with omni search bar and UI enhancements.

#### Challenges

It was a great learning experience overall, but a few challenges which proved to be a great enriching experience was working with VCRpy for IGitt tests, Working docker images which can be spawned inside a docker container itself, Visualizing the bear selection user interface on the coala Online module. These were pretty tough challenges and I was able to complete it with research, consistency but most importantly with guidance of my mentors, who were always there for me throughout the GSoC period for which I am really greatful. I learnt a lot from them, and it was an extremely great experience to work under their mentorship.


#### Work to be done

The first task, is to get all the supporting tools like coala Online, coala-html and projects.coala.io need to incooperate user feedback on the changes user experience. 

<br>

coafile_bot will be able to do wonders on GitLab as well once GitLab introduces Notification API. Initally I want to promote it as much as I can so that developers can have general awareness about linting, the tools available and how coala comes into the picture, and from there they can use coafile bot and then ultimately improve their git workflow. 

<br>
Essentially the projects.coala.io page can be used for a particular program like GSoC, GCI and also for general project management of an organization. Now some organization may want more flexibility on a particular feature. Depending on what more coala needs for project management, and depending upon consensus of other organization voting on a new feature, there is a great room for improvement in projects.coala.io
