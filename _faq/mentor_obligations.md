question: "What are my obligations as a mentor during the GSoC?"
---
coala has two mentors for every project:

1.  **Primary mentor**: responsible for the administrative tasks of the project.
2.  **Secondary mentor**: has little to no responsibility, but provides backup
    and code review for aspects of the project which are relevant to their
    expertise.

We expect you to:

* Be active on [gitter](https://coala.io/chat).
* Blog at least once per milestone (this will be aggregated on
[blog.coala.io](https://blog.coala.io)).
Participate in weekly meetings with your student.
* Review your students pull requests timely.
* Get in contact with the admins if any even remotely
potential problems arise.

If you are interested in mentoring, please contact one of the admins
indicating the reason your open source project is suitable to be included as
a project to be mentored under the coala administrative umbrella.

List of admins is [here](http://projects.coala.io/#/mentors).
