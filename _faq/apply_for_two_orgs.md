question: "Should I apply in two organisations for GSoC ?"
---
Most GSoC applicants to coala will be unsuccessful, due to high demand. So, you need to be very well prepared, as there will be 60+ applications for 10 positions, and 30 of those applications will be of very high quality. 

As a precaution, you can apply in other organisations as well.
