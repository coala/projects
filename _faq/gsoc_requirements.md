question: "What are the requirements to be accepted for GSoC?"
---
Other than the [requirements from Google](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) you will have to meet the following:

* You have completed the [coala Newcomers guide](https://coala.io/newcomer)
* You have a submission to [our usability survey](https://coala.io/usability)
	so we know that you know how to *use coala*.
