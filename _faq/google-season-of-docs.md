question: "What is Google Season of Docs (GSoD)?"
---
Google Season of Docs is a program giving technical writers an opportunity
to contribute to open source projects, by paying them a three month stipend
and facilitating connections between writers and projects.

The goal of Google Season of Docs is to provide a framework for technical writers
and open source projects to work together towards the common goal of improving
an open  source project's documentation. For technical writers who are new to open
source, the program provides an opportunity to gain experience in contributing to
open source projects. For technical writers who're already working in open source,
the program provides a potentially new way of working together. Season of Docs also
gives open source projects an opportunity to engage more of the technical writing community.
