question: "A showcased project on the website doesn't have a mentor, but
	I'm interested in that project?"

You just have to choose a project and write an awesome proposal.
Mentors are set after we choose the projects (which is done by choosing the students).

Our policy is that we'll always mentor awesome projects, so as long as your proposal
is one of the winning ones, there will be a mentor for the project.
But as for all other projects it might help to talk to your possible mentors, and in
that case it also means trying to maybe find a mentor or at least talk to
devs/maintainers about your ideas possibly on [gitter](https://coala.io/chat).
