# Projects

A website that showcases projects!

## Purpose

This is designed for GSoC but can be used for other initiatives at the same
time. We use it for research theses, GSoC, GCI and maybe others in the future.

Why?

- It's way more appealing to students.
- You can search and filter projects.
- Project ideas as structured data are more concise and you're sure to have all
  points covered - at the same time we can show students an overview and showing
  the full information only when needed.
- A proper review process can be used for triaging and iterating on project
  ideas.
- Stop wasting time maintaining a mentors list. This can be generated from the
  projects.

## Defining Projects

Mentors and admins can define projects as JSON using the following structure:

```json
{
  "name" : "Write Project Name Here",
  "desc" : "The project name should be like a good commit message - use \
imperative tense. You can use markdown in all fields.\
\
This one is the main description. Use it wisely.\
\
For a good project description try to get:\
\
- at least two mentors,\
- a related issue,\
- proper milestones.",
  "requirements" : [
    "The applicant has to fulfill this to get started."
  ],
  "difficulty" : "low|medium|high",
  "issues" : [
    "https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/####"
  ],
  "mentors" : [
    "sils",
    "sims1253"
  ],
  "milestones" : {
    "GSoC 2017 Coding Starts" : [
      "Conceptual work should be finished.",
      "The student have a repository, know how to work with the community.",
      "The applicant should know the community."
    ],
    "GSoC 2017 Midterm" : [
      "Everything listed here has to be reviewed and merged by midterm.",
      "No exceptions to that. Changing the goals is possible together with \
  mentors.",
      "Yes, that includes tests and documentation."
    ],
    "GSoC 2017 Final" : [
      "Everything has to be reviewed and merged.",
      "Including tests and docs, again."
    ]
  },
  "initiatives" : ["GSoC"],
  "tags" : ["Plugins", "CI"]
}
```
