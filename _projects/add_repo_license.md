This is a repeatable task for Google Code-in.

## Task

Add a license file to a GitHub repository so that the license
of the repository is recognised by GitHub, allowing the repository
to appear in the GitHub search by license results.

## Requirements

This task only requires use of the GitHub web interface.

## Process

There are three steps for this task:

1. Find a repository without a recognised `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file.
2. Determine the most appropriate license for the repository.
3. Create a pull request adding a recognised `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file.

----

## Step 1

Start by looking through
[GitHub repositories without a recognised license](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=-license%3Amit+-license%3Aapache-2.0+-license%3Absd-3-clause+-license%3Agpl+-license%3Acc+-license%3Algpl&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
sorted by "most stars" or "most forks".

Check that GitHub does not show a recognised license at the top of the repository.
See [Adding a license](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/)
for a picture of a recognised MIT license.

Check that the repository does not have a `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md` file.
Maybe GitHub does not recognise the contents of the file.

Also look in the repository for a license file with a different file extension,
such as `license.txt`, or a directory with multiple licenses,
such as https://github.com/xl1/armiku .
If you find a repository like this, the following steps are not appropriate.
Instead, it may be appropriate to move the existing file.
If you like to explore this type of problem,

is a GitHub search which finds thousands of these repositories, and
[here](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=-license%3Amit+%22Permission+is+hereby+granted%2C+free+of+charge%2C+to+any+person+obtaining%22&type=Repositories)
is a GitHub search which shows repositories with a slightly different yet
similarly difficult problem to be solved.
However, it is recommended that you return to Step 1 and select a new repository
which doesnt have any license files.

Check the pull requests for the repository.
Maybe someone has already proposed a license file.
Do not send another pull request to add a license file.

Also avoid small repositories which are personal learning projects,
or repositories without any code, or abandoned projects.

Avoid 'mirror' repositories, where pull requests are not wanted on GitHub.
Many projects host their coding activities in another git system, and mirror
the commits to GitHub.  These projects may appear in search results, and
should be skipped.

## Step 2

### Does the repository already have a license selected?

It is quite common for a repository to not have a LICENSE or LICENSE.md
file, but still have already selected a license which is recorded
in a different way.

If the repository has already chosen a license, it is not appropriate
to suggest a different license.  Therefore it is very important to
try to find the existing license.

Maybe the repository has a README.md file which mentions the license.

The chosen license may exist in other files, such:
- `package.json`

Check the issues in the repository.
Maybe an issue already contains a discussion about licensing choices.

A good approach is to search the repository for the words `license`
and `licence`, and read each search result for hints of existing
licenses.

If there is no license mentioned anywhere in the repository,
there are still other ways to find the most appropriate license.

Check the other repositories created by the main contributors.
Maybe they consistently use a license, and simply forgot to add
it to the repository that you have found in Step 1.

If you are confident that you have found the license that is implicitly chosen by the project team members, skip to Step 3.

### Or, choose a suitable license for a repository without any licenses

Determining which license to propose for a respository is not easy.

That decision is usually best left to the existing team of contributors,
who may have a strong preference that they have not disclosed publicly.

It is recommended that beginners go back to step 1 and find a different repository that already mentions a specific license.

## Step 3

The text for many licenses can be obtained from https://choosealicense.com/

1. Copy it to the clipboard.
2. Fork the repository
3. Add a LICENSE file to the repository, committing the new file to a branch.
   1. Be aware that many licenses provide template values that must be substituted with the correct values
4. Submit your branch to the main repository as a pull request.

A quick way to create a license file is to create a fork and then create a URL
using the following template.

`https://github.com/<your username>/<repository name>/community/license/new?branch=license&template=mit`

Replace `mit` with the short license identifier that GitHub has allocated to the selected license.
