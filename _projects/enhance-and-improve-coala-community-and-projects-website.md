### Overview
The motivation here, is to enhance and improve the websites ([community](https://community.coala.io) and
[projects](https://projects.coala.io)) for the coala community, for newcomers
who wish to start contributing to coala open-source organization and for other
organizations. The hurdle that newcomers mainly come across is the invitation
to the organization before making any contributions, so this project adds a
form for newcomers who wish to join the coala community. Also, to give a
motivation to existing contributors, coala has created a `Promotion form` which
will promote them to `coala Developer` status. To reduce the workload for
maintainers, this project includes the development of form with some
rudimentary checks that will promote the coala-newcomer to coala-developer.
Moreover, this project adds major enhancements to websites that will help
newcomers as well as developers to know more about this community and about
what they have contributed to it.
