This project aims to intensify usage of coala by developing well organised
interfaces on web.

Usually when first time users land on coala website, they want to know how
to install it, run it, get the results as soon as possible. It'd be helpful if
the website offers a bear search mechanism. Users can search bears and filter
the search results on basis of language, its ability to detect and fix code
problems and more such parameters. Furthermore the website can show analytics
related to Bears like, the most popular bears, recently created bears.
The contributors and community are an essential part of coala.
The website can show coala activity of contributors in an interactive manner,
like having a dashboard type view showing data of each contributor.

Lots of amazing things happen in coala at the same time. This project also
aims to develop the coala blog and push it towards becoming a platform to
share these stories. A better designed platform in terms of user interface
and experience.

We currently have coala-html to view coala analysis results in the browser
in a beautiful format, out of CLI world. But some of its components require
user interaction with CLI, for eg: starting up coala-html requires
`coala-html -h`. If coala-html is converted to a cross platform
desktop application using frameworks such as Electron, we can have a CLI
independent tool.

Upstream contributions to Web Technologies, Electron are encouraged.
