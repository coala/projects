##### Rationale

Glycans are tree-like molecules which decorate the surface of proteins. Known even as sugars or carbohydrates, they play a critical role in human diseases and they can potentially be used as biomarkers for pathological conditions. The increasing interest in this class of molecules prompt the need of an intuitive interface for drawing glycans on the web.

Even though tools like GlycanBuilder are already tackling this problem, they lack of intuitiveness and, more important, they are not anymore updated. In this context, we started the development of a new online framwork called SugarBuider.

SugarBuilder is compose by two components: the former is a JavaScript library designed to handle glycan information in a graph-like data structure; the latter is a web interface, developed with d3js, which allows the user to draw glycan structures from a browser.



##### Approach

Due to the early stage of Sugarbuilder, many aspects are only drafted or need refinements and improvements. In this context, we find two milestones which would constitute the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) work:

-    Improve the design and the user experience of the minimal web interface already present in the framework.

-	Enhance the JavaScript library by adding parsers and writers for different glycan encoding standards.

-	Possible creation of a Web component using Google Polymer.
    Since we are strongly support creativity, after a survey on the existing code, any suggestion from the candidate will be evaluated with our mentors.



##### Challenges

The work would combine creativity and programming challenges. In first place, the candidate should come up with new ideas for the user interface which will enhance its usability and flexibility (creativity challenges). Afterwards, the implementation phase will take place bringing in all the problems related to software development (programming challenges).



##### Requirements

The candidate should have a good knowledge in web development, especially with JavaScript and D3js. Creativity and design skills related to web interface development are considered an advantage. Existing knowledge on glycans is not compulsory, information material will be sent before the beginning of GSoC to familiarize with this class of molecules and its shapes.
