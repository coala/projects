In the future, coala will choose the bears to run for the user based on what
aspects of a programming language he wants to analyze. This project should
realize this.

The aspects concept exists as
[cEP-0005](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md) and it is
already possible to define aspects and use them in bears - however this has no
effect because coala doesn't understand what to do with them yet.

This project is about implementing aspects support in coala. coala will have to
choose the right bears on the basis of aspects and show the right results.
It should be able to ignore aspects just like bear ignoring works right now.
