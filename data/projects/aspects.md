This project is about annotating results of bears with "aspects" which are like categories allowing to group results.

In the future, coala will choose the bears to run for the user based on what aspects of a programming language he wants to analyze.

The aspects concept exists as
[cEP-0005](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0005.md) and it is already
possible to define aspects. Also, bears can already return results which are properly
annotated with aspects.
