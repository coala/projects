Imagine a `git blame` for performance. That is exactly what this project
is about - identifying commits that are interesting from a performance
point-of-view.

In this project, we aim to research for techniques to classify performance
changes across commits - find a correlation between the number of line
additions/subtractions and the performance change, identify whether a new
feature is really an optimization and so on.
