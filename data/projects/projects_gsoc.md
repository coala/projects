coala has made a unique webpage in the form of [projects](projects.coala.io).
The basic philosophy behind [projects](https://projects.coala.io) can be
extended to other organizations as well.

The procedure for GSoC can be improved by making a new template website that
all interested mentor organizations will be asked to use starting from
GSoC 2018. This template website will not be exactly similar but will borrow
certain ideas from the [projects](https://projects.coala.io) webpage.

However, an important point to note for this project is that there must be
communication between the student and team-GSoC so that this website is 
actually used from GSoC 2018 onwards.

The end goal of the project is to make GSoC a much better programme than
what it is now in terms of -

* Number of projects that are actually used by the mentor orgs after GSoC is
  over and merged into their code-base.
* Higher hit-rate as far as number of successfully completed and merged
  projects are concerned.
* Team coala will gain from this because the website will be used by thousands
  of students and hundreds of organizations across the globe, so everyone will
  know that the author of this website is Team-coala.

#### MILESTONES

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* A survey is done on the importance of each aspect. Feedback from the coala
  community, GSoC team and leading organizations has been taken.
* Concept for implementation exists in a new cEP.
* A repository has been set up.

##### CODING PHASE 1

* Implemented at least half of the points listed in the proposal.
* The written code has been tested and documented.

##### CODING PHASE 2

* Implemented, documented and tested second half of points listed.

##### CODING PHASE 3

* Implemented, documented and tested all improvements.
* This will be a buffer period for any remaining points and implementing
  enhancements.
