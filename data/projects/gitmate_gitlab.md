At coala we use GitMate as an automatic reviewing tool to reduce the time spent
with simple mistakes like trailing whitespaces and lines that are too long.
We also use it to gate merging pull requests before the commits are approved by
a maintainer.
All these features make dealing with the growing amount of pending pull requests
easier and allow us to focus in the important aspects of the code and skip the
manual scrutinizing of simple formal errors.
It essentially serves as a CI that comments issues directly in your Pull request
for you to fix.
The only problem with it is, that it only supports GitHub at the moment.

Most of coala's repositories are located at GitHub but some are with GitLab.
As GitMate and it's git wrapper IGitt will be released as open source, this is
the perfect opportunity to not only support all coala repositories but enable
GitMate support for all GitLab users.
To complete the big three git hosting providers, support for Bitbucket has to
be added. This way most developers using git should be able do benefit from
GitMate.

GitMate is a plugin system for handling events from a Git hosting platform like
GitHub.
Eventually it will support automatic code review via coala, just as
[the prototype](http://gitmate.io) does.
It is currently developed as a plugin platform so plugins can be reused
for any git hoster and just plugged into hooks, similar to the GitHub webhooks.

GitMate was originally written using flask microframework and was never
opensourced. A newer opensource version of GitMate, is being actively developed
at [gitmate-2](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/open-source/gitmate-2), with a
configurable plugin architecture. Some of GitMate's plugins are welcome
commenter for PRs, automatic issue labelling based on keywords, PR labelling
based on size, pending/WIP indicator for PRs, static code analysis per commit,
hot spot identifier based on Google's bugspot algorithm, etc.

The goals of this project are:

- Add [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and
  [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) support for
  [IGitt](https://gitlab.com/gitmate/IGitt)
- Add GitLab and Bitbucket support for all existing hooks in GitMate
- Extend and rewrite gitmate with django web framework.

- If the API was extended, the other supported platforms on IGitt serve the new
  features as well.

- Discuss new ideas on creating further plugins for gitmate-2 and create mocks
  for them.
