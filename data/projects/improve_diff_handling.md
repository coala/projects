Bears should be able to offer more than just one possible patch 
for an issue. Users should be able to choose between different patches, e.g. 
for different possible spelling corrections.

In addition bears should be able to offer templated patches, e.g. to offer 
variable renamings while the user should be asked for the new variable name.
