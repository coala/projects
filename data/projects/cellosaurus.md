##### Rationale

The cellosaurus is a knowledge resource on cell lines. It attempts to describe all cell lines used in biomedical research.

##### Approach

Two enhancements should be carried out concerning the [Cellosaurus](http://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus/):

-	Development of a Web-based tool to compare a user entered STR Marker profile for a cell line with all the STR marker data stored in the Cellosaurus. The program would run an algorithm similar to that described in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772516/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3772516/)

-	 Development of a Wikidata "bot" (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Bots) to enter some of the data stored in the Cellosaurus into Wikidata. The exact specification of the mapping of Cellosaurus data into Wikidata properties/clains and statements is being finalized. The bot would be ran at every release of the Cellosaurus to update the existing Wikidata cell line concepts and create new ones for cell lines newly entered at each release.

##### Challenges

- The amount of different cell line

 Understand RDF.


##### Requirements

- The student must have read the publication and understood the algorithm.
- The proposal has to contain a clear concept.
