Generic Bears have the potential to be awesome.
They provide language agnostic analysis algorithms like checking if you use the
preferred quotes in your file.
They have started to get there, but are not as reliable and feature complete as
we'd love them to be.

This project touches the most important, but often overlooked, work in open
source projects. Maintenance.
These new and cool bears were merged in euphoria as they were... well new and
cool.
But as with all code, they contain bugs and sometimes cases were missed and so
they now lie there, waiting to be looked at again, while the euphoric hordes
moved on, to the next new and cool feature.
Imagine WALL·E and the whole coala project being the earth.
(It is not as bad as in the movie, we promise!)
There are some WALL·Es out there, trying to fix the most important bugs and
errors, but there simply aren't enough as most developers have more in common
with the humans in that movie.

This project is about getting the once new and cool features into a state, that
makes them useful in production.
Until then, they are mere prototypes to feed the everlasting hunger of new and
cool things.
These bears can be found
[here](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/tree/master/bears/general). Issues
related to generic bears can be found 
[here](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aarea%2Fgenericbears%20).

The task is to fix as many issues with these bears and make them as usable
as possible.

#### Milestones

##### PREPARATION/BONDING

* The Student has identified at least 10 important issues
  (barring newcomer difficulty) that need to be solved.
* All issues are discussed, and a general idea behind the algorithm of
  most generic bears is developed.
* New changes to these algorithms (if required) are proposed.

##### CODING PHASE 1

* The student has developed an idea to implement at least 1 proposed Generic
  Bear (either by the community or the student).
* The student has discussed an initial algorithm behind the proposed Bear.

##### CODING PHASE 2

* Half of the issues defined in the proposal are resolved.
* The bare-bones version of the proposed Bear is implemented, tested and
  documented.

##### CODING PHASE 3

* A given set of issues defined in the proposal are resolved.
* The proposed Bear is fully implemented, tested and documented.
