The Project is about fixing issues with Generic Bears.

Generic Bears have the potential to be awesome, and they have started to get
there, but still require a some issues to be fixed. For eg: QuotesBear is not
reliable, AnnotationBear needs to give a better more detailed API, 
IndentationBear looks cool but is not usable yet. These bears can be found 
[here](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/tree/master/bears/general).

The task is to fix as many issues with these bears and make them as usable
as possible.

### Milestones

##### GSoC 2017 Community Bonding

 * The Student has identified at least 10 important issues (barring newcomer difficulty) that need to be solved and has developed an idea 
 to implement atleast 1 proposed Generic Bear (either by the community or the student).
 * All issues are disccused, and a general idea behind the algorithm of
 most generic bears is developed.
 * New changes to these algorithms (if required) are proposed.
 * Student has discussed an initial algorithm behind the proposed Bear.

##### GSoC 2017 Midterm

 * Half of the issues defined in the proposal are resolved.
 * The barebones version of the proposed Bear is ready.

##### GSoC 2017 Final

 * A given set of issues defined in the proposal are resolved.
 * The proposed Bear is ready and usable.
