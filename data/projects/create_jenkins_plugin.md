Jenkins users should be able to see coala results right in the 
Jenkins UI. The result of this project should be a full fledged Jenkins 
integration, living in an own repository with a full testsuite.

If you find this fun you'll be the one knowing this component best and will 
get the chance to maintain it on your own if you want - always with the
support of the community guarding your back of course.
