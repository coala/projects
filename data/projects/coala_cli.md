[cEP-0004](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/pull/29/files) was meant to improve
the usability of coala. It is a very important proposal that never got the time
and love it deserved.

Goal of this project is to finish the cEP and implement usability improvements
defined in it.

Ideally a candidate comes up with own ideas that are not sketched in the cEP
yet!
