Statistics like :

#### Normal stats
- How many times was coala ran? 

#### Data regarding coala patches
This would give us insights into how many patches suggested by coala actually
turn out to be correct and how many are not. Accordingly, eventually we may
be able to propose patches with accurate confidence.

- How many patches did coala suggest to the user? 
- How many of those patches were accepted by the user? 
- How many of the patches proposed by coala were edited by the user? 
- How many patches/errors were ignored/silenced? (Incorrect errors...)

#### Misc. 
- Repository specific statistics, Bear specific statistics and global statistics.
- How many changes did coala bring to the source code? 

#### Using the data for promotion
- Option to permit coala transmit these data to the coala server. 
- Showcase the visualisations of the data on the coala website. 

Data visualisations are a good means of promotions and also to prove the power of coala(and help it conquer the world eventually.)
