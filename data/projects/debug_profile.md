In the development lifecycle of a Bear it needs to be debugged and profiled
and coala should provide a comprehensive environment
for this. In this project the participant shall develop a system to easily
step into the analysis code (likely using the Pdb module already integrated
into Python) and step out as soon as the analysis finished.

#### Milestones

##### GSOC 2017 CODING STARTS

* The applicant has made a [cEP](https://coala.io/cep) of how the profiling
  will be implemented.
* The applicant is familiar with pdb.
* The applicant is familiar with core coala codebase.

##### GSOC 2017 MIDTERM

* Pdb should be integrated completely into the coala core.
* Settings of Bears can be accessed in the debug environment.
* Documentation and tests for the above task should also have been completed.

##### GSOC 2017 FINAL

* The profile option to CLI is added and merged.
* The ability to inspect results produced by the bear is implemented.
* The documentation about profiling is written.
