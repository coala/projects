\
A very easy way to cover a broad spectrum of analysis routines \
is wrapping linters into coala. Currently we have a `Lint` class which \
simplifies this integration. Based on this class, a large selection of \
linters can be implemented rapidly. A tutorial on writing linter bears \
is available at [the linter documentation]\
(http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Linter_Bears.html).\
The number may vary based on the difficulty to integrate any given tool.\
\
This project proposal should contain a concrete list of linters that are \
wrapped together with concrete improvement proposals to the `Lint` class \
if needed. Because implementing a linter bear is a rather trivial task it is \
highly recommended to spice up the project with something interesting, \
like adding project wide linter support to the Lint class. Improving \
integrations by adding more options can also be part of this.\

Upstream contributions to linters are encouraged, e.g. to add auto fixing \
abilities.",
