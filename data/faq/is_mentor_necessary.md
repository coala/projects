You just have to choose a project and write an awesome proposal.
Mentors are set after we choose the projects (which is done by choosing the students).

Our policy is that we'll always mentor awesome projects, so as long as your proposal
is one of the winning ones, there will be a mentor for the project.
But as for all other projects it might help to talk to your possible mentors, and in
that case it also means trying to maybe find a mentor or at least talk to
devs/maintainers about your ideas.

Note however, that it is always a good idea to discuss your proposal and project
milestones' feasibility with the developers and the larger coala community on [gitter](https://coala.io/chat).

You will almost always get valuable feedback for your project which in turn will increase your chances of
getting your GSoC proposal accepted!
