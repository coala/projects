The whole point of "Open Source Software" is to encourage celebration of
complete independence in sharing and writing code.
If you do honor original authors, licenses, and the "creator" of an original
idea, there is no shame in saying "he had a great idea, I think I can implement
it".
It's called "collaboration".
Note though, that not following licenses and not disclosing an original
creator of something is considered stealing and can have legal consequences.
On the plus side, we will always take into account who came up with something
and if you help others succeed, we'll definitely credit you for that.
Most importantly, we want our contributors to work as a team and not like some
"lone hackers" keeping secrets from fellow contributors, and sending
unnecessary private messages to the project mentors.
