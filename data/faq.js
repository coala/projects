	"ans" : "Please design your project in a way that you have **multiple \
checkpoints**. We'd like you to specify at least three partial goals so if \
something goes wrong for a valid reason, we can rearrange your schedule \
meaningfully. Each of those goals has to be merged into the main coala \
codebase in order for it to be considered \"complete\". You should be aware \
of what that involves for you (writing tests, going through extensive code \
review, learning :), reiterating).\
\
You can use any project idea listed here or one that came out of your mind - \
however be sure to make us aware of your plans and start planning your project \
with us so we can coordinate and - in the worst case - prohibit waste of time \
from your side. At all cost make sure you find something that interests you. \
We want this to be a fun and educating experience for you!\
\
Use the \"draft\" feature on the GSoC system, submit your draft early, get a \
lot of helpful feedback from us!"
