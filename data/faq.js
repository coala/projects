[requirements from Google](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) \
you will have to meet the following:\
\
- You have completed the [coala Newcomers guide](https://coala.io/newcomer)\
- You have a submission to [our usability survey](https://coala.io/usability)\
  so we know that you know how to *use coala*."

as a pull request."

{
	"ques": "How do I work out a great proposal?",
	"ans" : "Please design your project in a way that you have **multiple \
checkpoints**. We'd like you to specify at least three milestones with \
specific goals: if something goes wrong for a valid reason, we can rearrange \
your schedule meaningfully. Each of those goals has to be merged into the main \
coala codebase in order for it to be considered \"complete\". You should be \
aware of what that involves for you (writing tests, writing docs, going \
through extensive code review, learning :), reiterating).\
\
You can use any project idea listed here or one that came out of your mind - \
however be sure to make us aware of your plans and start planning your project \
with us so we can coordinate and - in the worst case - prohibit waste of time \
from your side. At all cost make sure you find something that interests you. \
We want this to be a fun and educating experience for you!\
\
Use the \"draft\" feature on the GSoC system, submit your draft early, get a \
lot of helpful feedback from us!"

	Just drop by and leave us a message! In addition, most mentors have their \
	mail addresses exposed on their GitHub profile."

The earlier you start, the better!"

\

- Blog at least once per week (this will be aggregated on \
	[blog.coala.io](https://blog.coala.io)).\
- Participate in weekly meetings with your mentor.\
- Get stuff merged, before the deadlines!\
- Get in contact with your mentors or the admins if any even remotely \
