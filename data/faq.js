[requirements from Google](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) \
you will have to meet the following:\
\
- You have completed the [coala Newcomers guide](https://coala.io/newcomer)\
- You have a submission to [our usability survey](https://coala.io/usability)\
  so we know that you know how to *use coala*."

	"ans" : "Please design your project in a way that you have **multiple \
checkpoints**. We'd like you to specify at least three milestones with \
specific goals: if something goes wrong for a valid reason, we can rearrange \
your schedule meaningfully. Each of those goals has to be merged into the main \
coala codebase in order for it to be considered \"complete\". You should be \
aware of what that involves for you (writing tests, writing docs, going \
through extensive code review, learning :), reiterating).\
\
You can use any project idea listed here or one that came out of your mind - \
however be sure to make us aware of your plans and start planning your project \
with us so we can coordinate and - in the worst case - prohibit waste of time \
from your side. At all cost make sure you find something that interests you. \
We want this to be a fun and educating experience for you!\
\
Use the \"draft\" feature on the GSoC system, submit your draft early, get a \
lot of helpful feedback from us!"
