bio: >
  A senior student at National Institute Of Technology, Kurukshetra major
  in Information Technology. For GSoC, I worked on
  [coala-pyflakes](https://gitlab.com/coala/bears/coala-pyflakes) and
  [pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes). The project was to
  integrate pyflakes-enhanced AST into coala as a metabear which was
  then used to develop various plugins. The second part of the project
  was to write plugin bears using the developed `PyFlakesASTBear`.

        .coafile: Add NoFutureImport bear
---

### Integrate Pyflakes-Enhanced-AST into coala

#### Work Done

There has not been an option to use the pyflakes-enhanced-AST based
checker API to create custom linters. Thus, the full potential of
enhanced AST isn't utilized, a whole lot of rework is required to do
the basic traversing and collection of important nodes. Pyflakes provides
with a basic API that does the traversing. So, if a developer uses enhanced
AST he just needs to work on the implementation of the new logic that his/her
plugin provides and not about the fidelity of the basic node handlers.

**Major tasks of the project:**

1. Create a separate repository `coala-pyflakes` to house all
   pyflakes based plugins.
2. Create package `pyflakes_bears` to hold `PyFlakesASTBear` and all the
   coala bears developed using it.
3. Create package `pyflakes_generic_plugins` that consists generic plugins
   which can be integrated with `flake8` and other such similar wrappers.
4. Design and develop `PyFlakesASTBear` that provides helper functions
   that can be used to traverse pyflakes AST of the input python module.
5. Establish the proof of concept by creating `NoFutureImportBear` that
   detects and fixes any usage of `__future__` imports in a python file.
6. Add handlers for `ARGS` and `ARGUMENTS` and provide the functionality
   of partial code analysis in `pyflakes`.
7. Create a `PEP8NamingBear` that detects all pep8 naming violations
   in a python file. Special handling is also done to detect violations
   in doctests which other similar plugins fail to perform.
8. Create a `BuiltinsBear` that is capable of detecting redefinition
   of python builtins in a module.

#### Challenges

The challenge of the project was to implement the `PyFlakesASTBear` in
such a way that a plugin developer need not worry about writing his own
traversing logic and need to have much no more than the knowledge of
PyFlakesASTBear nodes to write the bears. However, designing the logic
first by writing cEP(coala enhancement proposal) for
[coala-pyflakes](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0025.md) helped
me a lot to understand the problem to a deep level and come out with a logic
to tackle it.

#### Future prospects of the projects

The `PyFlakesASTBear` now allows bear developers to detect codesmells
and anti-patterns in python programs allowing to create more bears and an
equivalent generic plugin. `coala-pyflakes` can be used to safe house
checks which are more strict hence can't be directly incorporated in
`pyflakes`. The bear framework can be further enhanced to include the
functionality of executing flake8 plugin as is.
