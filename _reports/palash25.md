bio: >
  I am second year student of B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering at
  International Institute of Information and Technology, Bhubaneswar,
  Odisha, India. I worked as a GSoC student under coala to improve coala's
  I/O mechanism using `FileFactory` class and adding features to provide
  more support for NextGen-Core's caching mechanism.

         Added `Directory` class. This class will act as an interface
         to directories providing useful information about them. The
         objects of this class can be used by bears that operate only
         on directories and perform analysis based on the things like
         directory structure.

         Added `memoized_property`. `memoized_property` is a decorator
         that caches the properties of `FileFactory` class.

### Optimize Caching for the NextGen-Core

#### Work Done

1. Improved I/O mechanism for coala.
   1. Added a class `FileFactory` to interface with files and to provide file
      contents in different forms like string, binary data or as a tuple.
   2. Added a `Directory` class to interface with directories and provide
      useful information about them such as the directory path, parent
      directory and timestamps. This will be later used to implement ignore
      directories functionality.
   3. Added documentation for `FileFactory` and improved the NextGen-Core
      docs.

2. Caching support.
   1. Cached the properties of `FileFactory` which turned out to be a
      significant performance boost in consecutive coala runs.
   2. Added support for unordered collection types in `persistent_hash`
      which improved the NextGen-Core's ability to hash much more
      complex task objects (which are used in NextGen caching).

3. Integrated `FileFactory` with the core.
   1. Added line endings support for `FileFactory`.
   2. Implemented a middleware `FileDict` that mimics a dictionary
      and provides the bears in the old core with the actual file
      contents instead of the `FileFactory` objects thereby maintaining
      backwards compatibility with the old core.
   3. Modified the tests to use actual files and the `FileFactory` objects
      instead of hard-coded file contents.

#### Challenges

One of the first challenges I faced was designing the `FileFactory`.
But with my mentors help we were able to come up with a design that
could be used for the NextGen-Core and also maintained compatibility
with the old core.

The biggest challenge that I faced these three months for the integration
of the aforementioned `FileFactory` with the core. Initially about thirty
tests were failing but after discussing the idea of using a middleware
(`FileDict`) to maintain backwards compatibilty with the old core the test
failures were significantly reduced to just six. After a while I discovered
that `FileFactory` was somehow removing line-endings from the file contents
which was fixed by adding support for newlines in `FileFactory` which in turn
led to a successful integration.

#### Work to be done

Two major features were left out because of time constraints:
1. Ignore directories functionality for the NextGen-Core.
2. Cache control flags for the NextGen-Core (which was
   already mentioned as a stretch issue in my GSoC proposal).
