### Improving whitelisting infrastructure for Vulture

#### Work Done

1. Created a command line tool which takes in sip files as input and spits a
   whitelist with all the virtual functions defined in the [sip][sip] files.
   This tool was further used to create a whitelist for PyQt which can hereby
   be used with any project using PyQt. The tool is now completely tested and
   documented.

2. Created `--make-whitelist` flag to enable reporting of the results in a
   format which can be directly used as a whitelist. This significantly eased
   the process of creating and maintaing a whitelist for a project.

3. Implemented an ignoring mechanism for Vulture (`--ignore-names` and
   `--ignore-decorators`) - thereby enabling users to omit the result(s) which
   match with the given argument(s) (a glob pattern). This is particularly
   useful for projects using Flask where `--ignore-decorators "@app.route"` can
   be used to ignore all functions with the `@app.route` decorator (The
   functions exposed via the public API which aren't used internally).

4. Increased test coverage of Vulture from already excellent 95% to 100%. Also,
   ensured support for Python3.7 in CI and started testing Vulture with
   Python3.8-dev.

5. Switch to `argparse` instead of using `optparse` in Vulture.

6. We also did an experimental integration with `coverage` so that we could
   automatically remove the false positives. However, this scheme didn't quite
   fit the workflow involved when working with Vulture, so we dropped the idea.

7. Along with documenting the new features in Vulture, the already exisitng
   docs were also added upon. Most significantly, we tabulated the exit codes
   for Vulture and mentioned a few examples with their respective command and
   output in the project's README section.

#### Challenges

The biggest challenge for me was to ensure that the workflow involved for
using Vulture stays simple and that we don't overengineer it. Thankfully, my
mentors could foresee this and helped me throughout.
